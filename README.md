## Changes
Doombot 2.0 is a complete rework/overhaul of all Doombot functionality.
- All commands converted into Slash Commands.
- Simplified logic behind most commands.
- Simplified command usage across the board.
- Tournaments
  - Automated many tournament functions
  - Improved tournament start
  - Added tournament mission support
  - Added automatic XP calculation
  - Added custom XP rank cards
- Added Overwatch workshop wiki (workshop.codes) commands
- Added tags command for easy access to a common knowledgebase.
 
All these improvements will allow a good chunk of clutter to get removed from the Discord server (depricated and/or redundant channels).
